# Suggest Awesome GitHub Copilot Prompts

Analyze current repository context and suggest relevant prompt files from the [GitHub awesome-copilot repository](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/README.prompts.md) that are not already available in this repository.

## Process

1. **Fetch Available Prompts**: Extract prompt list and descriptions from [awesome-copilot README.prompts.md](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/README.prompts.md). Must use `#fetch` tool.
2. **Scan Local Prompts**: Discover existing prompt files in `.github/prompts/` folder
3. **Extract Descriptions**: Read front matter from local prompt files to get descriptions
4. **Analyze Context**: Review chat history, repository files, and current project needs
5. **Compare Existing**: Check against prompts already available in this repository
6. **Match Relevance**: Compare available prompts against identified patterns and requirements
7. **Present Options**: Display relevant prompts with descriptions, rationale, and availability status
8. **Validate**: Ensure suggested prompts would add value not already covered by existing prompts
9. **Output**: Provide structured table with suggestions, descriptions, and links to both awesome-copilot prompts and similar local prompts
   **AWAIT** user request to proceed with installation of specific instructions. DO NOT INSTALL UNLESS DIRECTED TO DO SO.
10. **Download Assets**: For requested instructions, automatically download and install individual instructions to `.github/prompts/` folder. Do NOT adjust content of the files. Use `#todos` tool to track progress. Prioritize use of `#fetch` tool to download assets, but may use `curl` using `#runInTerminal` tool to ensure all content is retrieved.

## Context Analysis Criteria

üîç **Repository Patterns**:
- Programming languages used (.cs, .js, .py, etc.)
- Framework indicators (ASP.NET, React, Azure, etc.)
- Project types (web apps, APIs, libraries, tools)
- Documentation needs (README, specs, ADRs)

üó®Ô∏è **Chat History Context**:
- Recent discussions and pain points
- Feature requests or implementation needs
- Code review patterns
- Development workflow requirements

## Output Format

Display analysis results in structured table comparing awesome-copilot prompts with existing repository prompts:

| Awesome-Copilot Prompt | Description | Already Installed | Similar Local Prompt | Suggestion Rationale |
|-------------------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| [code-review.md](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/prompts/code-review.md) | Automated code review prompts | ‚ùå No | None | Would enhance development workflow with standardized code review processes |
| [documentation.md](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/prompts/documentation.md) | Generate project documentation | ‚úÖ Yes | create_oo_component_documentation.prompt.md | Already covered by existing documentation prompts |
| [debugging.md](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/prompts/debugging.md) | Debug assistance prompts | ‚ùå No | None | Could improve troubleshooting efficiency for development team |

## Local Prompts Discovery Process

1. List all `*.prompt.md` files directory `.github/prompts/`.
2. For each discovered file, read front matter to extract `description`
3. Build comprehensive inventory of existing prompts
4. Use this inventory to avoid suggesting duplicates

## Requirements

- Use `githubRepo` tool to get content from awesome-copilot repository
- Scan local file system for existing prompts in `.github/prompts/` directory
- Read YAML front matter from local prompt files to extract descriptions
- Compare against existing prompts in this repository to avoid duplicates
- Focus on gaps in current prompt library coverage
- Validate that suggested prompts align with repository's purpose and standards
- Provide clear rationale for each suggestion
- Include links to both awesome-copilot prompts and similar local prompts
- Don't provide any additional information or context beyond the table and the analysis
