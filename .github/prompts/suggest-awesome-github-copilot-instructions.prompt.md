# Suggest Awesome GitHub Copilot Instructions

Analyze current repository context and suggest relevant copilot-instruction files from the [GitHub awesome-copilot repository](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/README.instructions.md) that are not already available in this repository.

## Process

1. **Fetch Available Instructions**: Extract instruction list and descriptions from [awesome-copilot README.instructions.md](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/README.instructions.md). Must use `#fetch` tool.
2. **Scan Local Instructions**: Discover existing instruction files in `.github/instructions/` folder
3. **Extract Descriptions**: Read front matter from local instruction files to get descriptions and `applyTo` patterns
4. **Analyze Context**: Review chat history, repository files, and current project needs
5. **Compare Existing**: Check against instructions already available in this repository
6. **Match Relevance**: Compare available instructions against identified patterns and requirements
7. **Present Options**: Display relevant instructions with descriptions, rationale, and availability status
8. **Validate**: Ensure suggested instructions would add value not already covered by existing instructions
9. **Output**: Provide structured table with suggestions, descriptions, and links to both awesome-copilot instructions and similar local instructions
   **AWAIT** user request to proceed with installation of specific instructions. DO NOT INSTALL UNLESS DIRECTED TO DO SO.
10. **Download Assets**: For requested instructions, automatically download and install individual instructions to `.github/instructions/` folder. Do NOT adjust content of the files.  Use `#todos` tool to track progress. Prioritize use of `#fetch` tool to download assets, but may use `curl` using `#runInTerminal` tool to ensure all content is retrieved.

## Context Analysis Criteria

üîç **Repository Patterns**:
- Programming languages used (.cs, .js, .py, .ts, etc.)
- Framework indicators (ASP.NET, React, Azure, Next.js, etc.)
- Project types (web apps, APIs, libraries, tools)
- Development workflow requirements (testing, CI/CD, deployment)

üó®Ô∏è **Chat History Context**:
- Recent discussions and pain points
- Technology-specific questions
- Coding standards discussions
- Development workflow requirements

## Output Format

Display analysis results in structured table comparing awesome-copilot instructions with existing repository instructions:

| Awesome-Copilot Instruction | Description | Already Installed | Similar Local Instruction | Suggestion Rationale |
|------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| [blazor.instructions.md](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/instructions/blazor.instructions.md) | Blazor development guidelines | ‚ùå No | blazor.instructions.md | Already covered by existing Blazor instructions |
| [reactjs.instructions.md](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/instructions/reactjs.instructions.md) | ReactJS development standards | ‚ùå No | None | Would enhance React development with established patterns |
| [java.instructions.md](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/instructions/java.instructions.md) | Java development best practices | ‚ùå No | None | Could improve Java code quality and consistency |

## Local Instructions Discovery Process

1. List all `*.instructions.md` files in the `instructions/` directory
2. For each discovered file, read front matter to extract `description` and `applyTo` patterns
3. Build comprehensive inventory of existing instructions with their applicable file patterns
4. Use this inventory to avoid suggesting duplicates

## File Structure Requirements

Based on GitHub documentation, copilot-instructions files should be:
- **Repository-wide instructions**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (applies to entire repository)
- **Path-specific instructions**: `.github/instructions/NAME.instructions.md` (applies to specific file patterns via `applyTo` frontmatter)
- **Community instructions**: `instructions/NAME.instructions.md` (for sharing and distribution)

## Front Matter Structure

Instructions files in awesome-copilot use this front matter format:
```markdown
---
description: 'Brief description of what this instruction provides'
applyTo: '**/*.js,**/*.ts' # Optional: glob patterns for file matching
---
```

## Requirements

- Use `githubRepo` tool to get content from awesome-copilot repository
- Scan local file system for existing instructions in `instructions/` directory
- Read YAML front matter from local instruction files to extract descriptions and `applyTo` patterns
- Compare against existing instructions in this repository to avoid duplicates
- Focus on gaps in current instruction library coverage
- Validate that suggested instructions align with repository's purpose and standards
- Provide clear rationale for each suggestion
- Include links to both awesome-copilot instructions and similar local instructions
- Consider technology stack compatibility and project-specific needs
- Don't provide any additional information or context beyond the table and the analysis
